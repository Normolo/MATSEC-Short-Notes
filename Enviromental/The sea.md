# The Sea

Wave action is responsible for erosion, transportation, and deposition of material along the coast, resulting in various coastal features such as wave-cut notches, platforms, and cliffs. Coastal erosion can lead to the formation of headlands and bays, and headland erosion can result in caves, arches, stacks, and stumps. The Maltese Islands offer examples of these coastal landforms.
