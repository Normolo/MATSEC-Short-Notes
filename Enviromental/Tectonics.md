# Tectonic Activity

The Mediterranean region is known for its high seismic activity. Countries such as Greece, Italy, and Turkey are prone to earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. The structure of the earth consists of the core, mantle, and crust. Plate tectonics explain the causes of earthquakes and volcanoes. Earthquakes can be dangerous and result in loss of life and property damage. Volcanoes can be categorized as active, dormant, or extinct. They pose hazards such as damage to property and natural environments, but also offer benefits such as fertile soils, formation of precious stones, geothermal energy, and tourist attractions.
