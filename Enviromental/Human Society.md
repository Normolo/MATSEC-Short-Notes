## Human Society

### Socialisation Process
Socialisation is the process by which individuals learn the norms and values of their society, which enables social cohesion. Norms are the socially accepted behaviours in a society, while values are the guiding principles that determine what is considered important. Norms and values play a crucial role in the process of societal development and influence the way individuals interact with each other and with their environment.

### Education for Citizenship
Education for citizenship is an important aspect of societal development. It aims to promote active participation in society, by fostering knowledge, skills, and attitudes necessary for individuals to become responsible citizens. Education for citizenship can be divided into two main types: national citizenship and global citizenship.

### Malta's Contribution to Peace
Malta has played an important role in promoting peace in Europe and the Mediterranean region since its independence. One of the most significant contributions was the hosting of the Malta Summit in 1989, which led to the end of the Cold War. Malta has also been actively involved in various peacekeeping missions, and has been a strong advocate for dialogue and cooperation in the Mediterranean region.
