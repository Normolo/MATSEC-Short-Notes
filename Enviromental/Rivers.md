# Rivers

A river basin contains several features, including gorges, waterfalls, flood plains, meanders, and alluvial soils. Flooding is caused by various factors, such as flat land, heavy rainfall, deforestation, and clearing of farmland for buildings and streets, as well as climate change. Flood control measures offer benefits but can also cause problems.
